# Pi AD2
A replacement monitor for the Schwinn Airdyne AD2, built for a Raspberry Pi.

# Requirements
Uses [ClapDetector](https://github.com/tom-s/clap-detector), which requires `sox`. See the ClapDetector instructions for installing `sox` on Linux or Mac.

# Installation
This process needs a big improvement at some point.

1. Clone to `/home/pi/`
1. Run `cd /home/pi/pi-ad2` and then `npm install`
1. Run `cp misc/pi-ad2.desktop ~/Desktop`
1. Launch with the desktop shortcut. It may take 10+ seconds for Chromium to open, due to the build process.
